//Assignment 1 - A girl who knows what she wants
// When it is rainy on Thursdays or when it is cloudy on weekends,
// Sarah likes to order Thai food for dinner.
//  Otherwise she just likes to make a ham sandwich at home.
//  Except on Tuesdays Sarah always orders pizza regardless of the weather.
//  Oh and if thereâ€™s ever a thunderstorm Sarah simply must eat tacos
// (except on Tuesdays, obviously).
